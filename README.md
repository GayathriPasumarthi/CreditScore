**Credit Risk Prediction Project**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit risk, utilizing a German credit risk dataset. 
The solution involves an end-to-end pipeline from data analysis to model deployment.

Key Features:
Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Explored and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values and preparing the data for model training.

Model Training & Evaluation: Trained and compared the performance of several tree-based classifiers including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees Classifier, and XGBoost.

Optimal Model Selection: The XGBoost model was selected as the final model due to its superior accuracy and performance on the evaluation metrics.

Real-Time Deployment: The final model was deployed as a real-time predictive web application using the Streamlit framework. 
This allows users to input data and receive instant credit risk predictions.
